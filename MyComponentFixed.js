The solution is to ensure that the component is properly exported from its module. Add `export default MyComponent;` (or `export { MyComponent };` if you're using named exports) at the end of your component file.  Here is corrected `MyComponentFixed.js`:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <View>
      <Text>This is MyComponent</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
